To extend the application to be able to handle multiple request at a time.
Possibly I am going to start with the simplest of the databases in python i.e. SQLite as it is already built into python. Later on I will have to start comparing the features with other relational databases and look to switch to them as the complexity increase. Will also look at NoSQL databases and their use cases.
